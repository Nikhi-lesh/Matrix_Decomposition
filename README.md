# Matrix_Decomposition
A Matrix decomposition (or) matrix factorization is a factorization of a matrix into a product of matrices.
Matrix decompositions are an important step in solving linear systems in a computationally efficient manner.
There are many different matrix decompositions; each finds use among a particular class of problems.
Here,I only implemented two of them namely QR & LU decomposition.
